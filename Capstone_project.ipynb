    "Given the fast-moving pace of economic and technological advancement in todayâ€™s world, most people, especially from the younger generation, tend to experience some form of mental health issues in their lifetime. There has been a significant increase in individuals experiencing suicidal ideation. While it may appear that such individuals do not explicitly communicate their distress, a closer examination of their online activity, such as social media posts, comments, and engagement patterns, often reveals underlying emotional states indicative of psychological distress. This could help researchers, students, and practitioners to develop early detection models for mental health support. The goal is to encourage data-driven approaches to mental health awareness, prevention, and support systems. Mental health awareness is primarily in the healthcare and psychology domains, focusing on the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of mental health conditions. \n",

    "The target audience for this NLP model are health care professionals (such as therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists), and mental health organizations and clinics, where they can prioritize high-risk cases, or monitor trends in mental health conditions across populations. This model could be used to identify early symptoms of the mental health of individuals in our society. We were able to find a brief description of mental health in the Practical Natural Language Processing( A Comprehensive Guide to Building Real-World NLP Systems) book, which gave us the idea of tackling this project. The motivation for the project is try and improve the diagnosis  and treatment of mental health by identifying underlying conditions at an early stage.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mental health care professionals often rely on their experience, degrees and studies to make a diagnosis on the mental health of an individual. We are trying to build a tool that can coexist with their expertise in this field in order to accurately classify individuals with mental health conditions.Mental health care professionals can use statements made by patients  and use our model to analyse the words used and give a diagnosis on the mental health of the patient. This model is meant to work along with the knowledge that our capable health care professionals have, it should be used cautiously to ensure there is minimal or no misdiagnosis. This model will also be available to the public for anyone who would like a quick self assessment should they  protrary signs of a mental breakdown, but they should ensure to do further consultation with their mental health care provider.\n",

    "\n",
    "The main objective is to build a model that can correctly classify mental health conditions based on given text or statements used by the public or individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.2 Specific Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific objectives of the project are:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Translate our text data to swahili to make the dataset localized.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Determine the most common mental health condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Preprocess the data through processes such as; Vectorization and tokenization, handling missing values, and creating new features such as characters, words and sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use wordcloud to visualize and identify the most commonly used words for a specific mental health condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use text length to classify a mental health condition or show correlation  with a mental health condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Evaluate the model performance using Precision, Recall, F1score, Accuracy Score and Roc.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Compare different classification models to determine which performs best for this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Scrapping data from an online platform like twitter to show the efficiency of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Create a translate feature where we can change a english text to swahili text to allow for intrepretability and diversity in our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.3 Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can we translate our data?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which is the most common health condition?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Which features influenced mental health condition?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Which words were specific to a certain class?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Which classifier model had the best Precision, Recall,F1 score, Accuracy score and ROC?\n",

    "6. Which classification model performs best for this dataset?\n",

    "7. Was our model efficient after making use \n",

    "### 1.5 Success Criteria  \n",
    "\n",
    "The success of this project will be assessed in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It should generate insights into how users feel about their products and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A machine learning model should be successfully developed that automatically determines the sentiment of a tweet based on words and tone used in the text.\n",
